// Write a function that, given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), 
// returns an array of the top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.

// A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in ASCII. 
// Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.
// Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
// If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty array if a text contains no words.

// Bonus points (not really, but just for fun):
// Avoid creating an array whose memory footprint is roughly as big as the input text. 
// Avoid sorting the entire array of unique words.
