What to expect: 

You will have 5 interviews when you are onsite and each interview will last about 60 minutes. 
These in-depth conversations will be around work experiences from your background. 
After your interview the team will come together to discuss how you did during the process.

60% of the interview is going to be focused on technical areas/coding and 
40% will be behavioral questions based around Amazon’s Leadership Principles. 

There are several documents attached that will be vital to your interview preparation:

• Acing the Amazon SDE Interview 
• Acing the Amazon Behavioral Interview 
• Amazon Systems Design 
• Leadership Principle Worksheet (this is something that you can use to prepare some examples for those behavioral questions) 
 
The below videos will also be vital to your preparation:
System Design: https://youtu.be/gNQ9-kgyHfo
Coding Sample: https://youtu.be/mjZpZ_wcYFg
Leadership Principles: https://youtu.be/CpcxVE5JIX4
 

These technical concepts will be similar to the questions asked during your interviews:
“Amazon parking lot example design” and be familiar with those concepts
“Solve boggle board algorithm”
“Binary search questions”

General Interview Tips:

Be Specific: Reference data points that catalyze or justify decisions you’ve made.

Ask Questions: 
    Ask clarifying questions. 
    There are often ambiguous situations to deal with in the work place, and so there will be a few in your interviews. 
    Asking questions will give you a clearer understanding of the challenges presented by the team, 
    and gives the interviewers insight into how you dive deep on issues and solve problems. 
    This can make a huge difference in you interviews.

Be Honest: 
    Some interview questions may be negatively oriented. (ex. “Can you tell me about a time when you didn’t meet a deadline?”) 
    We all have setbacks, but what’s important is how you handle them, and what you learn from them. 

Take Ownership: 
    Be mindful of appropriately using “I” vs. “we” statements. 
    Spend more of your time speaking to your responsibilities and what you've accomplished, 
    as oppose to what your team as a whole accomplished.  

Dress: 
    Business Casual/Casual. Amazon is a pretty comfortable environment. 
    We’re interested in what you can accomplish more than what’s in your closet.
 
After your interviews, when you have a moment, please send me an informal email to confidentially share how the interviews went from your perspective. Hiring is one of the most important things we do at Amazon to grow and scale our business and your feedback is valuable as we strive to improve the candidate experience. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.
