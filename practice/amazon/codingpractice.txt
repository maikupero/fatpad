Coding on the whiteboard.
Amazon wants to understand:

1. Do I know my CS fundamentals?
2. Do I have a heuristic for problem-solving? Do I just randomly approach problems?
3. Do I write clean, logical, maintanable code that others can understand?

It's not: "Have you done every single problem you've read online?"
It's more: "
    1. Do you not jump into the proble immediately without looking at the space that it's in?
    2. Do you try and disambiguate the problem. 
        Ask quiestions. 
        Understand the inputs and outputs. 
        What are some of the edge cases you need to be worried about?
    3. Do you talk this through out loud? It should be a dialogue, not a recitation. 
        Help them understand what I'm thinking and why.

Expect 2-4 questions. 

---- Example 1
Run Length Encoding. Older lossless compression algo, used for image files. 
aaaabbccc => 4a2b3c.. but what if
aaaabbccca => 5a2b3c? no. need to acount for this edge case. should be 4a2b3c1a
so hash map is not optimal.
so iterative approach!
