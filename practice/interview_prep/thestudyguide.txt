Behavioral interview practice
Practical Examples
• teaching english, curriculum redesign convince kurome, double students.
• talking about kal and hiring someone for something i couldnt do, and trying to delegate tasks.
• directing movie in kyoto, made sure they scouted locations and contacted temples for legality and shooting windows.
• translating even fine print for bilingual website stak.
• Bike tour Japan convince Rob to expand to hiroshima area.
• regarding starting company in japan - finding lodging, legality, taxes, visas, promises from reservations.
• sounds of japan / video yurano / web design with photography.

Coding Examples
• path of studying, algorithm -> cs50 -> build stuff
• discord bot
• vanilla js apps attempt to begin react apps 
• built community of people on discord. i know their toolsets.
• workflow stuff, how i look for efficiencies, new tech, git.
• build site for stak, my experience and what i learned from that.

Search

    Binary

Merge Sort 
Quick Sort

Binary Tree (recursive traversal)

Queue/Stack:
    Brackets problem 

Linked Lists  

Hash Tables - look through characters that make up the string, do math on them, generate a mostly unique key, store it with that.
balance of processing time hashing vs storing.

*****************
EXAMPLES TO BUILD:
    - Query json at API, parse data and return. 
    - (E)book store. Talk about how to design the API.
    - notification system.
    - get, post API curls.
*****************


API _ 
talk about validation before user data comes out. 
does it fit the model? if not we reject request and give error message. 

domain - access points, production for users, but also lower level environments for development. locational use.
resources - server stack resources, what does the computer in cloud. 
params - like the headers in a get request, what info i want to get. 

Fetch, promises, async await.
BUILDING A DATABASE 
    Databases - 
        Foreign key (unique) / primary key
        Composite - for many to many relations, 3rd column that is an index. 
            or composite key is combination of the two. 
            reject duplicates.

--- STATE MANAGEMENT ---
Unidirectional Data Flow
Redux
Context

--- CLASS VS FUNCTION COMPONENTS --- 
WHAT    The old vs new in react. 
        Functional accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.
        Class components require you to extend from React.Component and create a render function.
        All about hooks and plugging into lifecycle. 
WHY     In the past, they were used for different purposes, but API changes + hooks led to functions being used for everything. 
USE     So much cleaner and more logical.


--- HOOKS IN REACT, BINDINGS/STORES IN SVELTE ---
WHAT    Let you "hook into" react state and lifecycle features from function components. 
WHY     As above, makes building dynamic websites a breeze - passing props etc unnecessary.
USE     Built in ones like useState, useEffect, useContext, and can also create own.

--- COMPONENT LIFECYCLE ---
Phases of life (the flow of the code -> website).
    | Mounting (component created and placed in DOM) 
    | -> Updating (occurs when state of components or its props change)
    | -> Unmounting (component destroyed and removed from DOM tree)
A series of methods triggered at appropriate phases, like componentDidMount, render.
Methods of each phase of a component's life with use example:
How to use hooks to hook into the right part of the cycle:
Know the differences between old and new API as some have been deprecated.

--- HIGHER ORDER COMPONENTS ---
Pattern emerging from React's compositional nature.
higher order components convert components into another component. 
example is Redux's connect.
* Allows us to define repeating logic in one place and use it in many components.
* Alternative is to create your own hook with reusable logic.

--- VIRTUAL DOM, OPTIMIZE LISTS ---
 > Every person using React in their professional work should know the UI update mechanism implemented in this library.
In-memory representation of a DOM.
Component State change -> React updates VDOM -> 
-> Diffing algorithm compares differences. 
Optimize lists using a 'key' prop. Gives the element a stable identity, detects changes easily.
* Why even use VirtualDOM?

--- ASYNC CODE ---
Callbacks 
    • functions called when the result of async operation is ready.
    • problem is code becomes unreadable with multiple async operations in a row. callback hell.
Promises 
    • dont need a callback, has its own functions that are called upon success/failure.
    • ability to change instead of nesting consecutive callbacks.
Async/Await
    • syntactic sugar on promises, makes async look more sync, more readable.
Example with error catching, how to perform several at same time.
