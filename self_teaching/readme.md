    This is where I began learning on July 20th, 2021, and the place I dump all things coding related.
    
    You can find:
    • All my algorithm and coding practice in /practice:
        • Current ongoing series of the Top 100 liked Leetcode challenges, alternating Py and JS.
        • Countless Leetcode & Codewars challenges, often recommended to me by current professionals.
        • Advent of Code 2020 and 2021.
        • Series on recursion, linked lists, etc - wherever I felt like I needed extra practice with concepts.
    • Various studies I've undertaken in /studies
        • My course work from CS50, completed over 2 months in the Fall.
        • Dabbling in rust and cpp, though this was truly mostly studying and less practical application.
        • Web Dev work - various tutorials from experienced programmers, react, web apps, DB setup, and games.
    • Random Scripts I've made in shell and python.
    • Templates for starting apps and projects.
    • A collection of resources for learning, doing, and improving code in resources.
