flask as a framework so every single time you want to do anything
in your web app you dont have to specifically write out every single http request

design patterns such as MVC
        MODEL   
updates↓     ↑manipulates
    VIEW     CONTROLLER
    sees↓     ↑uses
         USER

web programming frame works let you factor out common content. in flask, layout.html
 {% block body %}{% endblock %}

 {% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}

    <h1>Register</h1>
    <form action="/register" method="post">

        <input autocomplete="off" autofocus name="name" placeholder="Name" type="text">
        <select name="sport">
            <option disabled selected value="">Choose a Sport</option>
            <option value="Dodgeball">Dodgeball</option>
            <option value="Flag Football">Flag Football</option>
            <option value="Soccer">Soccer</option>
            <option value="Volleyball">Volleyball</option>
            <option value="Ultimate Frisbee">Ultimate Frisbee</option>
        </select>
        <input type="submit" value="Register">

    </form>


in inspect html you can literally change the input data and send in values that aren't there.
onus is on the programmer to make sure users cannot do that.

instead, don't copy paste the options. 

in app.py..
