Web Development In 2022 - A Practical Guide
https://youtu.be/EqzUcMzfV1w


learn sass
further learn browser dev tools
learn tools: emmet, prettier, eslint, github copilot
deploying projects: netlify, vercel, cpanel, amazon s3
domain names: namecheap, domain.com, bluehost, godaddy

Basic frontend dev should be able to:
	• create website layouts with css/html
	• understand basic design
	• know JS and how to work with DOM
	• create basic interactive frontend apps
	• connect to APIs make basic requests with Fetch
	• work with GIT and use version control
	• deploy and manage small production projects

from there…
	—> web design
	—> frontend framework (react, vue, svelte, state managers, serverside rendering)
	—> backend (node, python, php, c#, go, mongo&postgres, http&api dev
	—> advanced js (module bundlers, testing, design patterns)

front end frameworks
	browser only loads single page, and rest is done through JS using framework
	for me probably react (facebook) and google (angular), but try vue and maybe svelte

typescript
	- dont need to define types….?? interpreted for you.
    - class, module support. apparently less prone to errors and more definitive code. 

ui kits
    all have some version of material and some version of bootstrap
    react: onsen, chakra
    angular: ng-zorro, ng-bootstrap
    vuetify: vuetify, buefy (bulma css)
    svelte: materialify, smelte

testing: 
    gonna learn this with bro, but
    e2e testing - emulating a user
    JS testing tools: jest, cypress, puppeteer

server-side rendering: cool aspect of modern webdev. away from single page apps, render frontend frameworks on the server. 
    next-react, nuxt-vue, remix-react, sveltekit, angular universal
static-site generators: uses data preloaded from various sources. very performant.
    gatsby-react, next, gridsome-vue, jekyll for ruby.

CMS - content management system for creating APIs with no frontend.
    strapi, sanity.io, contentful, graphcms. authentication tools built in, reduces workload of creating backend. 

server-side language & web frameworks:
    node.js (weaker with cpu heavy tasks), 
        express, fastify, koa, nest.js
    python (datascience, machine learning)
        django, flask, fastapi
    ruby 
        on rails, sinatra
    golang
        gin, beego
    rust (web assembly)
        rocket, actix web

Databases, mostly fine on but:
    postgresql, mysql, mongodb, firebase(mysql)/supabase(postgres), redis

REST APIs
    representational state transfer. 
    http requests to work with data/resources stored in DB then from app/http client make a request to API.
    basically - instead of loading whole site and navigating around it, create different endpoints from url.
GraphQL - apollo
    used like rest api, but requests data from single endpoint. more control for what you get back from requests. less maintenance.

Authentication, Authorization
    JSON web tokens
    Cookies & Sessions
    OAuth (login via google, twitter, github)
    Authentication Libraries (Passport, Grant, etc)
    Password hashing (Bcrypt)
    Protecting endpoints and routes

Deploying full stack projects & DevOps
    Hosting - AWS, heroku, digitalocean
    Server software - apache, nginx
    Containers & Virtualization - kubernetes, docker..  (really only for devops)
    Image & Video - cloudinary, amazon s3

Backend & Fullstack Web Developer
    • Comfortable with a serverside programming language
    • Know how to setup and manage a database & ORM/ODM
    • Know how to create REST apis from the ground up, implement authentication
    • Familiar with terminal and UNIX commands
    • Deploy apps and APIs in some kind of platform

Web3 stuff:
    blockchain, etherium & smart contracts, solidity programming, NFTs
Webassembly:
    lowlevel assembly language for the web. rust, c, c++, compile to WASM. assemblyscript for typescript. 
AI: 
    programming tools (github copilot), testing tools, ML APIs, chatbots, spam filters, suggestions etc.
