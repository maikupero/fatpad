.schema;

-- I'll keep the tables and their columns listed below for reference while I work.

-- Next we'll try the sample query given in the walkthrough to see what I get.
SELECT description FROM crime_scene_reports WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND street = "Chamberlin Street";
-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse.
-- Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€”
-- each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.

-- Following that, I can check for interviews from that day containing courthouse in their contents.
-- Also keeping 10:15 AM in mind.
SELECT transcript FROM interviews WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND transcript LIKE "%courthouse%";
-- I want to make sure I'm working with 3 interviews here.
SELECT COUNT(transcript) FROM interviews WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND transcript LIKE "%courthouse%";
-- Confirmed. Witness 1:
-- Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.
-- Witness 2:
-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- Witness 3:
-- As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
-- Takeaways:
-- 1: Within ten minutes, check security footage for cars that left the parking lot.
-- 2: Earlier that morning thief withdrew money from the ATM on Fifer Street.
-- 3: When leaving the courthouse, thief called someone and talked for less than a minute.
--  "planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow."
--  asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
