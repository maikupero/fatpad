flask as a framework so every single time you want to do anything
in your web app you dont have to specifically write out every single http request

design patterns such as MVC
        MODEL   
updates↓     ↑manipulates
    VIEW     CONTROLLER
    sees↓     ↑uses
         USER

web programming frame works let you factor out common content. in flask, layout.html
 {% block body %}{% endblock %}
