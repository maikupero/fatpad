------ RUST ------
$ rustc (file to open)
$ ./(executable file)

for new projects, in rust directory: 
    $ cargo new _____ --vcs=git (for gitignores when already in a git repository)
    $ cd _____
    ($ cargo build)  -- or just when you run it the first time is ok

for switching projects, in terminal cd ../(program)

To learn about dependencies: cargo doc --open

./target/debug/hello_cargo, cargo run, or check(compile without executable)
when done, cargo build --release

1. Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.
2. println! calls a Rust macro. If it called a function instead, println (no !)
3. "Hello, world!" string passes as argument to println!, and the string is printed to the screen.
4. Semicolon line enders are common (;).
5. Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words, 
and underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability

use std::io;    io: input output library, from standard lib

.gen_range(1..101);   inclusive on lower, exclusive on upper. alternatively: 1..=100

Variables
    let foo = 5; // immutable
    let mut bar = 5; // mutable (declare within a statement to show intent on changing the value)
    let complex_var = {
        let mut complex_var = ...
        // A bunch of complex code to initialize the variable
        complex_var // return value from scope
        }   
    shadowing is reassigning the binding from a variable to a new one. 
    original one keeps living in its scope.
        
Data Types 
    Default is 32. but for things like pixels, which are only 3 bits and there are
    billions of them, can use u8 for example. 
    Integers - numbers without fractions
    Floating-Point types - numbers with decimal points. default is f64.
    Numeric Operations - don't need to declare type
    Booleans    
        fn main() {
            let t = true;
            let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
            }
    Characters - four bytes, unicode scalar values, char literals '' string literals double ""
    Compound Types
        Tuples group together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. 
            fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
            fn main() {
                let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
                let (x, y, z) = tup; (or)
                let six_point_four = x.1;
                println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
        Arrays. All elements same type. BUT fixed length in rust.
        let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        let a = [3; 5];    same as    let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
        Vectors can grow or shrink. 

    Functions
        Must declare the type of each parameter.
             fn main() {
                another_function(10, 19);
            }

            fn another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {
                println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
                println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
            }
        Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.
            fn main() {
                let x = 5;

                let y = {
                    let x = 3;
                    x + 1
                };

                println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
            }
        Note the x + 1 line without a semicolon at the end, 
        which is unlike most of the lines you’ve seen so far. 
        Expressions do not include ending semicolons. 
        If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, 
        you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value. 
            fn five() -> i32 {
                5
            }
            fn main() {
                let x = five();
                println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
            }

Reverse string 
.split() - splits elements of a string into an array
.reverse() - reverses the elements in an array
.join() - joins the elements into a new string

push pop - add remove to end 
unshift shift - add remove to start

for ... of - for loop but maintains indeces
for ... in - for loop without indices

.map and .match are king

_______for loop that starts partway through but loops back around
var myArry = ["cool", "gnarly", "rad", "farout", "awesome"];
var offset = 3;
for( var i=0; i < myArry.length; i++) {
    var pointer = (i + offset) % myArry.length;
    console.log(myArry[pointer]);

.replace(/\s/g, '')
