Type in the examples by hand and compile them yourself.

As you make mistakes or find bugs in your programs, fix them. 

Try to solve your own problems before asking others for help. 

Experiment with the examples.

Write your own short programs using the concepts you have learned. 

Nothing is better than practice.

MACHINE LANGUAGE(code) - limited set of instructions that a CPU can understand directly

Sample machine language: 10110000 01100001

ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE invented because Humans can't read machine language - uses abbreviations.
CPU can't understand assembly language directly. Translate it to execute it. Use assembler. 
+ very fast
- require a lot of instructions to do even simple tasks. 
(like trying to understand a sentence by looking at each letter individually)
- not very portable -- outcome and readability depends on hardware.

Sample assembly language: mov al, 061h

HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES like C/C++ invented for people to code without worrying about the computer. 
Also have to translate for machine to read it. 

Sample High level language: a = 97;

COMPILER
code -> compile -> executable
executable -> run on hardware -> program results

INTERPRETER 
code -> interpreter -> run on hardware -> program results

The underlying design philosophy of C and C++ can be summed up as “trust the programmer."
Language often won’t stop you from doing things that don’t make sense, 
because it will assume you’re doing so for some reason it doesn’t understand.
+ Video games
+ Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc…)
+ High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
+ Graphical applications and simulations
+ Productivity / office applications
+ Embedded software
+ Audio and video processing
+ Artificial intelligence and neural networks

1. Define the Problem to Solve                      -what-
2. Design a solution                                -how-
3. write a program that implements the solution     
4. compile the program
5. link object files
6. test program
7. debug -> back to 4

The C++ core language is actually fairly small and concise. 
C++ also comes with an extensive library called the C++ Standard Library 
Provides additional functionality. Common is iostream library, which contains functionality for 
printing text on a monitor and getting keyboard input from a user. 
Almost every C++ program written utilizes the standard library in some form, 
so it’s very common for the standard library to get linked into your programs. 
Most linkers will automatically link in the standard library as soon as you use any part of it.

Types of statements in C++:
1. Declaration statements
2. Jump statements
3. Expression statements
4. Compound statements
5. Selection statements (conditionals)
6. Iteration statements (loops)
7. Try blocks

A function is a collection of statements that executes sequentially (in order, from top to bottom).
Every C++ program must have a special function named main (all lower case letters). 
When the program is run, the statements inside of main are executed in sequential order.

int main – ‘int main’ means that our function needs to return some integer at the end of execution.
Returning 0to the operating system as the last statement  is the standard, means “everything went okay!”. 

------------------------------------------ 1.2 ------------------------------------------

At the library, program, or function level, use comments to describe what.
Inside the library, program, or function, use comments to describe how.
At the statement level, use comments to describe why.

------------------------------------------ 1.3 ------------------------------------------

How do programs actually produce results? By manipulating (reading, changing, and writing) data. 
In computing, data is any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer.
*** Programs are collections of instructions that manipulate data to produce a desired result.

Memory / RAM / random access memory
Series of numbered mailboxes. each holds a piece of data while the program is running. 
A single piece of data, stored in memory somewhere, is called a value.

In some older programming languages (like Apple Basic), you could directly access these mailboxes 
"go get the value stored in mailbox number 7532"

In C++, direct memory access is not allowed. Instead, we access memory indirectly through an object. 
An object is a region of storage (usually memory) that has a value and other associated properties.
From Basic's 7532 to "go get the value stored by this object."
Focus on using objects to store and retrieve values, not where it's stored.
Objects can be named (variables with identifiers) or unnamed (anonymous).   

*** In general programming, object typically refers to a variable, data structure in memory, or function. 
*** In C++, the term object has a narrower definition that excludes functions.

In C++, the type of a variable must be known at compile-time (when the program is compiled), 
and that type can not be changed without recompiling the program.
+ C++ also allows you to create your own user-defined types.

Defining multiple variables of same type - int a;  int b;  -->  int a,b;
