    This is where I began my journey on July 20th, 2021, and the place I dump all things coding related.
    You can find:

    • All my algorithm practice in, you guessed it, /practice:
        • Current ongoing series of the Top 100 liked Leetcode challenges, alternating Py and JS.
        • Countless Leetcode & Codewars challenges, often recommended to me by current professionals.
        • Advent of Code 2020 and 2021.
        • Series on recursion, linked lists, etc - wherever I felt like I needed extra practice with concepts.
    • Various studies I've undertaken
        • My course work from CS50, completed over 2 months in the Fall.
        • Dabbling in rust and cpp, though this was truly mostly studying and less practical application.
        • Web Dev work - various tutorials from experienced programmers, react, web apps, DB setup, and games.
    • Random project ideas and other notes that will probably mean nothing to you but I keep them around anyways.
