    Unorganized mess approaching higher levels of organization. 
    These days, coding primarily in python. 
    Wrapping up CS50, working on a discord bot, and other projects. 

    Check out my work:
    (various) CS50 - fantastic 12 week course set up by Harvard. Highly recommend.

    (Python) Squirebot - a discord bot in production

---------------------------------- About Me -----------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name's Michael Perreault, 29 year old US/Canadian dual citizen 
moved back to the US to study coding after 2021 in Sweden, and 2015-2020 in Japan.

I spent my 20s pushing myself towards challenge instead of away from it.
As a result, I know these things:
1. I can learn anything, teach it, and get people excited about it.
2. I love people, communication and collaboration.
3. Joy and results come together from a balance of effort and environment.

I've been a teacher, a translator, a barista, a bike tour company founder (and guide),
a pilgrim, a photographer, a videographer, a local business consultant, and a web designer.
Every one of these experiences benefits me directly in my coding, which is my sole focus now.

Timeline: 
- 2010: Astrophysics @ Virginia Polytechnic Institute
- 2014: Dual degree Philosophy / International Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University.
    Background in community service and local development led to bikeandbuild.org across the US for affordable housing.
- 2015: Completed the Shikoku Pilgrimage on foot and lived in Japan for 6 years. During which I: 
    • Self-taught business-level fluency Japanese in two years.
    • Co-founded and ran for 3 years the massively successful biketourjapan.com
    • Began a successful freelance career of videography, photography, and web design.
    • Worked with coffee shops, libraries, tourism bureaus, guest houses across Japan.
    • Worked as a private educator and also as a translator.
    • Worked for tech startup stak, Inc. in Hiroshima, Japan - first opportunity to code.
- 2021: Moved to Sweden during the pandemic and decided to commit myself full-time to studying coding.

------------------------------ About My Learning ------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What: General path has been Javascript->C->Python.
Approaching learning coding as I learned Japanese.
Started with 2 months of codewars/leetcode to learn through immersion and necessity.
Dove into CS50 (3 month course) to learn a broader holistic approach and fundamentals.
Now coding in Python as I build projects every day, and having the time of my life.

When: Began full time self-study on July 20, 2021, more fun every day.

Why: 
• I want to work in a team. 
    Discovering that coding is not only collaborative, but a social and human
    form of art fascinates and motivates me deeply.
• It fits my lifestyle.
    It doesn't matter where I go or what I do in life,
    games, tech and coding are in my mind and every day.
    Embracing it, using my other skills to supplement coding,
    and using coding to bring my other skills to life. 
    This seems the path to fulfillment.
• The study of coding is joyful to me.
    For me, the balance of understanding and application is paramount.
    The most meaningful creation of any medium is manifested through 
    creating what is useful through true understanding.

How:
Balance of these 4:
• Deconstructive Approach - Daily leetcode and codewars problems, algorithms and logic, develop a coding mind.
• Constructive Approach - Lots of personal projects - try to make any idea you can conceptualize.
• Fundamentals - Any course that feels interesting, useful and concise.
• Community - Open-source projects, and as much collaboration and communication as possible.
