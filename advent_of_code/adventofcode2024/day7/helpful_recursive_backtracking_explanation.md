Certainly! Let's walk through what happens when we run the function with **4 operators** (for `n = 5`, which requires `n-1 = 4` operator slots). The possible operators are `+` and `*`.

---

### **Expected Combinations**

Since each of the 4 slots can independently hold either `+` or `*`, the total number of combinations is \( 2^4 = 16 \). Here they are:

```
++++, +++*, ++*+, ++**, +*++, +*+*, +**+, +***,
*+++, *++*, *+*+, *+**, **++, **+*, ***+, ****
```

---

### **Step-by-Step Execution**

Let’s simulate how the `backtrack` function generates these combinations. Below, each step shows the `current` string being built, and the recursive calls being made.

#### **Starting Point**
- `current = ""` (empty string)
- `depth = 0` (we’ve filled 0 slots so far)

---

#### **Depth 0: First Slot**
- Add `+` → `current = "+"`
  - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="+", depth=1)`
- Add `*` → `current = "*"`
  - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="*", depth=1)`

---

#### **Depth 1: Second Slot**
- For `current = "+"`:
  - Add `+` → `current = "++"`
    - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="++", depth=2)`
  - Add `*` → `current = "+*"`
    - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="+*", depth=2)`

- For `current = "*"`:
  - Add `+` → `current = "*+"`
    - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="*+", depth=2)`
  - Add `*` → `current = "**"`
    - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="**", depth=2)`

---

#### **Depth 2: Third Slot**
- For `current = "++"`:
  - Add `+` → `current = "+++"`
    - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="+++", depth=3)`
  - Add `*` → `current = "++*"`
    - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="++*", depth=3)`

- For `current = "+*"`:
  - Add `+` → `current = "+*+"`
    - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="+*+", depth=3)`
  - Add `*` → `current = "+**"`
    - Recursive call to `backtrack(current="+**", depth=3)`

- (Similarly for `current = "*+"` and `current = "**"`.)

---

#### **Depth 3: Fourth Slot**
- For `current = "+++"`:
  - Add `+` → `current = "++++"`
    - **Base case reached**, save `"++++"`
  - Add `*` → `current = "+++*"`
    - **Base case reached**, save `"+++*"`

- For `current = "++*"`:
  - Add `+` → `current = "++*+"`
    - **Base case reached**, save `"++*+"`
  - Add `*` → `current = "++**"`
    - **Base case reached**, save `"++**"`

- Continue similarly for all other strings (`"+*+"`, `"+**"`, etc.).

---

### **Output**

After all recursive calls and backtracking, the function builds the following list:

```kotlin
listOf(
    "++++", "+++*", "++*+", "++**",
    "+*++", "+*+*", "+**+", "+***",
    "*+++", "*++*", "*+*+", "*+**",
    "**++", "**+*", "***+", "****"
)
```

---

### **Visualization of Backtracking**

You can imagine this process as a **tree structure**, where each "branch" represents one choice (`+` or `*`) at each level:

```
                             ""
                 +                         *
           ++          +*           *+          **
       +++  ++*     +*+  +**     *++  *+*     **+  ***
    ++++ +++* ++*+ ++** +*++ +*+* +**+ +*** *+++ *++* *+*+ *+** **++ **+* ***+ ****
```

Each "leaf" in the tree is a final combination.

---

### **Efficient String Building**

The `StringBuilder` is crucial here because:
- At each depth, we only modify the current string (add one operator, then undo it).
- Instead of creating new strings every time, we reuse the same `StringBuilder` object.

For example:
1. `current.append('+')` adds a `+`.
2. After exploring all possibilities with this `+`, we backtrack using `current.deleteCharAt(current.length - 1)` to remove it.

This saves memory and speeds up the process compared to concatenating strings repeatedly.
