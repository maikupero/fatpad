store it serverside and do the actual API calls there. 
The backend should be acting as a proxy for your React app, storing the secrets, making the API calls, and then sending back data. 
For example in a React / Express app, you could make an Express endpoint to get the weather. 
You call the endpoint from React, then Express uses an API key to fetch 3rd party weather data before responding so that React can display the data.

The canonical way to use a third party API key is for your client side app to send a request to your backend API. Your backend API then formats the request as per the third-party API, adds the key and makes the call to the third-party API. Once it receives the response, it can either unpack it and translate it into domain objects which your front-end app would understand or send the raw response back to the front-end app. In this way, the API key stays at the backend and is never sent to the client-side.
